# Mainstream Landing Page Content

---

## Hero

### Headline
**Your design work is drowning in Slack.**

### Subheadline
Mainstream gives your team a home for design work — organized, visible, and effortlessly shared with stakeholders.

### CTA
**Get Started** | **Watch Demo →**

---

## The Problem

### "This week in design" shouldn't take all week.

You share work in Slack. It's buried by lunch.  
You screenshot for stakeholders. They never open the doc.  
You dig for context. The decision is lost in three tools.

**Design work deserves better than chat threads and Google Docs.**

---

## The Solution

### One place. Every design. Full context.

Mainstream is a living gallery for your team's work — searchable, organized by project, and automatically summarized for the people who need to stay informed.

---

## Core Features

### 🎨 Share Everything
Images. GIFs. Figma embeds. Loom videos. Paste a URL, upload a file — it just works.

### 🏷️ Streams, Not Folders
Tag work across multiple projects. That onboarding flow? It lives in `#mobile`, `#onboarding`, and `#q1-launch` — simultaneously.

### 💬 Feedback That Sticks
Comments live with the work. Six months from now, the context is still there.

### 📰 AI-Powered Updates
Select a week. Pick streams. AI generates the summary. Edit, publish, done. No more Friday afternoon newsletter scrambles.

### 👁️ Know Who's Watching
"Seen by 12 people" — hover for names. Know if stakeholders actually looked.

### 🔒 Private When Needed
Sensitive work stays locked. Role-based access. Invisible to everyone else.

## How It Works

**1. Upload** — Drop in designs, embeds, videos  
**2. Organize** — Tag with streams (many-to-many)  
**3. Engage** — Comments, likes, follows  
**4. Share** — Publish AI-generated Drops to stakeholders
